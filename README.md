# Minmum Analogy of UniSat Boards [OBC&SB]



Those are the minimum analogy of the UniSat OBC and SB.

NOTE:

In real UniSat Cubesats, we use RS485, it connects all of the subsystems, then each board converts RS485 signal to UART finally connected to the UART interface of their microprocessor/microcontroller, here we have just ignored the conversion detail.
